The following FBD mixes up symbols due to being from a different source.

$F_{spring} = k_p*(d - d_p)$ where d_p is the initial displacement of the primary spring

$F_{sheave}$ depends on belt tension and sheave geometry:

$R = N\sin(\phi/2)$ where R is a vertical force due to tension, and $\phi$ is the V angle. 

$N = F_{sheave}/\cos(\phi/2)$

$R = F_{sheave}\frac{\sin(\phi/2)}{\cos(\phi)} = F_{sheave}\tan(\phi/2)$

$F_{sheave} = R/\tan(\phi/2)$

R results from a distributed load of belt tension. From the Bestorq belt theory reference:

$R = T_0 \alpha$, where $T_0$ is the slack-side tension and $\alpha$ is the wrap angle around the sheave ($\alpha$ for primary, $\beta$ for secondary)

$F_{sheave} = T_0 \alpha/\tan(\phi/2)$

Finally, Rx, the reaction force from the roller linkage, must be determined using kinematics. The system acts like a 2-bar linkage where the first link extends from the point "R" to the roller with length $L$ and angle $\theta_R$. The second link extends from the roller to the edge of the ramp with length $r_{roller}$ and angle $\theta_N$

![image](figures/two_bar_linkage.png)

$D=\frac{x_2^2+y_2^2-L_1^2-L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}$

$\theta_2=\arctan(s_{elbow}\sqrt{1-D^{2}}, D)$, where $s_{elbow}$ is either -1 (elbow up)or 1 (elbow down)

$\theta_1=\arctan(y_2,x_2)-\arctan(L_2\sin(\theta_2),L_1+L_2\cos(\theta_2))$

An important note is that the ramp is defined by an arbitrary function, ramp(d), which returns a height from the base of the ramp. It is assumed that any result of this function will have the two-bar linkage in an "elbow-up" state.

Solving this system is not trivial, since $ramp(d)$ depends on the unknown $d$, which prevents the system from having any givens. We have constraints which must hold, though:

Free variables (7): $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, \theta_1, \theta_2, d$
Knowns: $L_1, L_2, ramp(d), ramp'(d), x_0, r_{cage}$

$x_1 = L_1\cos(\theta_1)$

$y_1 = L_1\sin(\theta_1)$

$x_2 = x_0 - d$

$x_2 = x_1 + L_2\cos(\theta_1+\theta_2)$

$y_2 = r_{cage} - ramp(d)$

$y_2 = y_1 + L_2\sin(\theta_1+\theta_2)$

$\theta_1 + \theta_2 = \arctan(ramp'(d)) + \frac{\pi}{2}$ where $ramp'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}ramp(x)$

With these 7 equations, we can in theory solve for every variable, but try as I might, I can't reach an analytic solution. This is mostly due to ramp(x) not being a known function. So, this nonlinear system must be solved numerically. It can be simplified to this system of 3 equations where the variables are $d, \theta_R, \theta_N$:

$\theta_R = \theta_1$

$\theta_N = \theta_1 + \theta_2$

eq1: $L_1*\cos(\theta_R) + L_2*\cos(\theta_N) - x_0 + d$
eq2: $L_1*\sin(\theta_R) + L_2*\sin(\theta_N) - r_{cage} + ramp(d)$
eq3: $\arctan(ramp'(d)) + \pi/2 - \theta_N$

Where each equation is set equal to 0.

The penalty method can be used, where penalty is minimized:

$E = eq_1^2 + eq_2^2 + eq_3^2$

Bounds need to be placed on $\theta_R$ and $\theta_N$ such that they remain in the range $[-\pi,\pi]$, otherwise the numerical solver may not converge due to the symmetry of angles.

The next step is to solve for the forces of the system:

To find the reaction force $R_x$, we need to use the centripetal force due to rotation of the primary.

$F_c = mr\omega^2$ where $m = m_{fly}/4, r = r_{fly}, \omega=\omega_p$

The two-bar linkage is usually applied in robotics, where the middle linkage can move. However, in this case the second link is a result of the roller on the ramp surface, so the entire ramp and roller piece can be treated as a single rigid body.

Solving forces and moments, with the quasi-static assumption:

$\sum{F_x} = R_x - N\cos(\theta_N)$

$\sum{F_y} = R_y - N\sin(\theta_N) + F_c$

$\sum{M_z} = F_c L \cos(\theta_R) - N x_2 \sin(\theta_N) - N y_2 \cos(\theta_N)$
where $x_2 = L\cos(\theta_1) + r_{roller}\cos(\theta_2)$
and $y_2 = L\sin(\theta_1) + r_{roller}\sin(\theta_2)$

With the constraints $\sum{F_y} = 0, \sum{M_z} = 0$, since the roller cannot move in the y direction and the roller's rotation can be treated as quasi-static.

Solving for N in the moment equation:

$N = \frac{F_c L \cos(\theta_R)}{x_2 \sin(\theta_N) + y_2 \cos(\theta_N)}$

With some careful observation, we actually do not care about the $F_y$ equation at all. It means nothing to us, and never will. We can just plug N directly into the $F_x$ equation to get
