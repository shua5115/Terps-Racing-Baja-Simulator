- Check belt stretch using E and max tension force (napkin math) to verify the constant length assumption
- Obtain static and kinetic friction coefficient of belt on sheaves
    - Napkin math
    - Check paper cited by WVU
    - Estimate from CVT data before belt obviously bites
        - Car inches forward
- Update WVU code to reflect current parameters
    - New engine
    - CVT tune
